1. It took me around 1 hour 30 minutes to complete the technical test.
2. I would say that the test was of intermediately challenging. The parts that made it easy for me was setting up the environment as I've set up multiple python environments in the past. Due to my experience, I was comfortable with using the baics of git, github, and python. The most challenging parts for me was using the pandas library as I do not have much experience with writing code with it. However, well-written documentation online definitely made things easier. I have also never used Flask before. It was cool using it for the first time.
3. Our best friend, Google. Google led me to sites like stackoverflow, the pandas and flask official websites, and a few other articles.
4. For each instruction step, I thought about whether I knew how to implement it. If I did, I went ahead and implemented it. If I didnt, I went straight to Google to find the best solution that suits the problem. As I worked, I used a browser for part 1 to check my progress. For part 2, to help ensure that I was correctly calculating numbers, I took a few samples from the source data, calculated the total sales, counted the number of transactions, and compared it to my results.
5. I had a lot of fun with this technical test. I liked this test as, not only did it test your ability to code the solution, but it also tested your ability to set up the environment, which is sometimes missed in other technical tests. Thank you, Quinyx for the lovely experience!
